# PS3 Decryption Archival Project

Our goal is to decrypt every PS3 game and catalog both the MD5 and SHA-1 hashes for each one.

The PlayStation 3 has been discontinued, along with its games. Therefore, there is no commercial market or profit to be made from distributing these titles. Making PS3 ROMs more accessible will not impact Sonyâ€™s revenue.

For most people, buying a PS3 console and its games is not feasible, especially in low-income countries. Many simply cannot afford the hardware or software.

This is strictly an archival project, not a commercial venture. The intent is to preserve and make these games accessible for historical and educational purposes.
